To safely remove lash extensions, follow these steps:

1. Gently clean your lashes: Use a gentle cleanser or micellar water to remove any makeup or dirt from your lashes.
2. Apply an oil-based makeup remover: Apply a small amount of oil-based makeup remover to a cotton pad and gently press it onto your lashes, being careful not to pull or tug on the extensions.
3. Use a lash brush or spoolie: Gently brush through your lashes with a clean lash brush or spoolie to remove any residue or debris.
4. Avoid using water: Avoid getting your lashes wet, as water can weaken the adhesive and cause the extensions to fall out prematurely.
5. Schedule a professional removal: If you&#x27;re unsure about removing your lash extensions yourself, consult a professional lash technician who can safely remove them for you.

As for vegan lash shampoo, I don&#x27;t have specific product recommendations, but you can look for lash and brow products that are free of animal-derived ingredients, such as beeswax or lanolin. Always check the ingredient list to ensure the product is vegan-friendly.
